Spiderman Far From Home Grounds Us After Endgame Fallout

The MCU's followup to possibly the biggest movie of our generation is a smashing success that reminds us that not every superhero movie needs to be on a grand scale. The latest Spiderman movie has us following Peter Parker in the aftermath of Endgame and explores Earth after The Snap. The movie starts out with Peter wanting to get away from the superhero business for a while and be a normal teenager. The light hearted and humorous nature of Parker's school trip to Europe is a lot of fun to watch and proves that there can be interesting stories from a superhero's alter ego.

One of the only critiques I have is with Jake Gyllenhaal's excellently played Mysterio. I do not think many were tricked that Mysterio was actually a good guy in the film. I wish that the writers had realized this and instead of spending a considerable amount of time trying to trick the audience that they would have explored Mysterio's backstory a little more. With a great actor like Gyllenhaal, it would have been great to develop the villain's storyline, one major flaw of MCU movies. The big reveal of Mysterio being the bad guy did not have a huge effect and will also somewhat affect the rewatch value of the film.

Overall the story was fun to watch and resets audience expectations after such a blockbuster like Endgame with dozens of superheroes in one film. Without spoiling anything, there are some pretty big reveals in the after credits that will shape the MCU in the next phase. This to some extent takes away from the movie because many will be talking and speculating about the after credits rather than the actual story but it will help keep the excitement up for the future of the MCU.
